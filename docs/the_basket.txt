The basis of many original currencies is a basket.

A basket consists of a number of items which become the keystone of a currency token.

Why a basket?
A basket is a stored value that provides the opportunity to trade against, as it holds current and available resources that would be the ultimate goal to fulfill needs.

Initial basket items would be:
+ salt
+ graphene
+ time
+ wheat

Early societies used grainaries as their basket, for leverage, when trading with other tribes.

Everything takes time to obtain, which is why the core value of all items in the basket will be converted to a time based token.  There is often concern about using time as a denominator as time of individuals can be subjective.  The idea of time as a measure is using "skilled" time.  Also, time to become skilled is not considered in the time equation, as the excercise of training is a seperate activity.  It still remains that someone who is skilled at an activity will be both efficient AND effective.

One of the more challenging aspects of a basket is how to value specific items, especially if an item is made of a number of components.  In that regard, items should be raw materials only.

Additional items in the basket may include:
meat, fruit / honey, minerals, energy, precious metals, fibres

Although with minerals and precious metals may not be in the initial basket.

Fibres would be for clothing, etc.
Energy might be wood, which would include for building homes

As a starting point on utilizing the basket as a stabilizer:
On placing goods or services "into" the basket, similar to a barter system, the "vendor" would acquire some equivalence in tokens.  Tokens could be redeemed for goods or services.  Also, goods and services can be traded as equivalence.

A basket would be the basis of a token based on the needs of one year, calculated against and average work done in a year.

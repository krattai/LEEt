Local Economic Exchange toolkit

This project is a combination of code and concept that arose from an idea in the Open Information project:<br>
https://github.com/krattai/Op_In/tree/master/econ_gov/open%20community/local%20economic%20exchange

The idea is to provide a toolkit of economic exchange methods and mechanisms with least resistance and most simplicity in order to enable people to conduct mutual transactions regardless of their capacity to access fiat currencies or their willingness to use fiat currencies.
